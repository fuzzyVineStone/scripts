## Scripts

This page is mostly dedicated to test the Github Pages feature.
It Is the page of my scripts. It is not yet very crowded, but I intend to add more as time goes by.

If you are interested, feel free to play around with or improve the code. The scripts are definitely not production ready, but they are good enough for their purposes.

#### Todo

1. translate.py
    + Atbash should overlook whitespace
    + Add more ciphers
